url_shortener: proxy path prefix, port 9200, concurrency, and Docker fixes

- Server port: switch default from 8080/8888 to 9200 (config, Dockerfile,
  docker-compose, env examples, scripts, tests).

- Docker Compose: remove QuestDB and Envoy; DB and Redis come from env
  (e.g. .envrc). Add PATH_PREFIX default /u_s for proxy deployment.
  Publish port as 127.0.0.1:9200:9200. Default WORKERS=1 so port
  publishing works reliably.

- Proxy /u_s support: serve correctly at kundu.dev/u_s/ and localhost:9200.
  - Use relative asset links in UX HTML (index, result, error) so both
    direct and proxied access resolve CSS/JS correctly.
  - When X-Forwarded-Prefix is set (Envoy), rewrite HTML and short URLs
    to use that prefix; when absent (direct access), keep relative links
    and no prefix so localhost:9200 loads /css/, /js/.
  - Add get_forwarded_path_prefix() and inject_forwarded_prefix_into_html()
  - Move HTML prefix helper to web_app/html_prefix.py to avoid circular
    import with web routes.
  - Add ENVOY_PREFIX_STRIP.md: prefix_rewrite and X-Forwarded-Prefix
    for http-proxy Envoy config.

- Concurrency: add config.workers and uvicorn workers; add
  tests/test_concurrent.py (concurrent health, shorten, stats, redirect).

- .envrc: set QUESTDB_URL and QUESTDB_CREATE_TABLES for app/env alignment.

- .env: set APP_PORT=9200 and BASE_URL=http://localhost:9200 (was 8080).
